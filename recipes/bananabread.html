  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This chocolate chip banana bread recipe makes two really moist, rich loaves. Great for breakfast or warm with butter as a dessert. The walnuts may be omitted if desired.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup shortening</li>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
    <li>6 very ripe bananas, mashed</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, cream together shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in mayonnaise and bananas. Stir together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Blend flour mixture into banana mixture; stir just enough to evenly combine. Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 50 to 75 minutes. Cool loaves in the pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
  </ol>
